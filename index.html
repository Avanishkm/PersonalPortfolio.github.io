            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or prabhu. Initially, education was open to all and seen as one of the methods to achieve Moksha in those days, or enlightenment.[citation needed] As time progressed, due to a decentralised social structure
                the education was imparted on the basis of varna and the related duties that one had to perform as a member of a specific caste.

While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible.

I learned how to identify with how my child is feeling, how to encourage them to explore and how to comfort them when they come back to me. I feel like I am more confident as a dad after it all. I appreciate how kind and accommodating you have been through the whole thing, there was never an issue if I had to miss a session, if I needed it to be done online or anything like that which I appreciated a lot. I'd just like to thank you for the time, I really did appreciate and get a lot from it all.
